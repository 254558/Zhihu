# 失业了每天都很崩溃，每天都哭怎么办?

你每天哭。
You cry every day.

我理解。
I understand.

可我不同情你。
But I don't sympathize with you.

不是因为我冷血，也不是因为我不明白那种“睁眼就破产”的感觉。
It's not because I'm cold - blooded, nor because I don't understand the feeling of "going bankrupt as soon as I open my eyes".

人类被剥夺生存权的方式从来不是被枪指着头，而是像你现在这样：
The way humans are deprived of their right to survive is never being pointed at by a gun, but like you are now:

“失业，然后自我崩溃。”
"Unemployed, and then self - collapsing."

你以为你哭，是因为没有工作。
You think you cry because you have no job.

错了。
Wrong.

你哭，是因为你不敢面对自己从来没有为生活建立起抵抗力。
You cry because you're afraid to face the fact that you've never built up the resilience for life.

你不是真的在痛苦，你只是——不习惯无意义的生存。
You're not really in pain; you're just - unaccustomed to meaningless existence.

失业，是现代社会给成年人设置的一道分水岭。
Unemployment is a watershed for adults in modern society.

在此之前，你还有同事、老板、KPI、打卡、外卖。
Before this, you had colleagues, bosses, KPIs, clock - in systems, and takeout.

在此之后，只剩下你和墙壁。
After this, there's only you and the wall.

一个[自我厌弃](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=736115664&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=自我厌弃&zhida_source=entity)的灵魂，对着另一张陌生的脸。
A self - loathing soul facing another strange face.

你说你每天都很崩溃。
You say you're collapsing every day.

怎么，之前上班的时候，你不是也经常崩溃吗？
What? Didn't you often collapse when you were at work?

你不是也天天骂公司傻逼、同事搞事、领导PUA？
Didn't you curse the company for being stupid, colleagues for causing trouble, and the leader for PUA every day?

你不是梦想自由吗？
Didn't you dream of freedom?

你不是说有朝一日能不上班，哪怕吃土也快乐？
Didn't you say that one day if you didn't have to work, you'd be happy even if you had to live in poverty?

现在给你实现了，你哭个什么劲？
Now that it's come true, why are you crying?

你看——
Look - 

人就是这种自相矛盾的生物。
Humans are such self - contradictory creatures.

我们梦想自由，得到自由之后又被自由吞噬。
We dream of freedom, but after getting it, we're devoured by it.

我们渴望解脱，解脱之后却立马被空虚打败。
We long for liberation, but after being liberated, we're immediately defeated by emptiness.

因为你从来没有建立起“我该如何活着”的标准体系。
Because you've never established a standard system of "how should I live".

你只是跟着社会走罢了。
You just follow society.

公司给你一个岗位，你就以为你的人生有了意义。
The company gives you a position, and you think your life has meaning.

工资到账，你就以为你做得对。
When the salary arrives, you think you're doing the right thing.

工作丢了，你就觉得你被世界淘汰了。
When you lose your job, you feel like you're being phased out by the world.

说白了，你不是崩溃。
To put it bluntly, you're not collapsing.

你只是——“无所适从”。
You're just - "at a loss".

你以为你的痛苦很独特，其实这只是“现代人的标配”。
You think your pain is unique, but in fact, it's just a "standard configuration for modern people".

这就是现代社会最阴毒的一点：
This is the most insidious part of modern society:

它会把人驯化成一个只会接收命令的机器。
It domesticates people into machines that only receive commands.

一旦拔掉电源，就不会动了。
Once the power is unplugged, they can't move.

你就是那台被拔掉电源的“人形工作机”。
You're that "human - shaped work machine" with the power unplugged.

没有电，就开始怀疑人生。
Without power, you start to doubt life.

所以你才会每天哭，哭到凌晨三点，哭到窗帘都发霉，哭到你邻居以为你家闹鬼。
That's why you cry every day, crying until 3 a.m., until the curtains get moldy, until your neighbors think there are ghosts in your house.

然后第二天照旧睁眼。
And then wake up as usual the next day.

刷手机，点外卖，内耗，自责。
Scroll through your phone, order takeout, internalize, and blame yourself.

看看朋友的朋友圈，别人出差、升职、看展、晒车。
Look at your friends' moments. Others are on business trips, getting promoted, visiting exhibitions, and showing off their cars.

你呢？
What about you?

躺平，翻身，叹气，再来一口奶茶。
Lie flat, turn over, sigh, and take another sip of milk tea.

你以为自己是失业了，其实你只是“脱钩”了。
You think you're unemployed, but actually, you've just "decoupled".

脱离了社会的节奏，失去了别人对你的投射。
You've deviated from the rhythm of society and lost the projection of others on you.

你再也不是“市场部张姐”“程序员小李”“客服主管王哥”。
You're no longer "Sister Zhang from the Marketing Department", "Xiao Li the programmer", or "Brother Wang, the customer service supervisor".

你只是你自己，一个没有职位头衔的裸人。
You're just yourself, a naked person without a job title.

你害怕的不是失业本身。
What you're afraid of is not unemployment itself.

你害怕的，是你一旦不赚钱，就像个废物。
What you're afraid of is that once you stop making money, you feel like a waste.

你说你每天都哭。
You say you cry every day.

很好。
Good.

哭是清洗。
Crying is cleansing.

你必须哭，你必须哭。
You have to cry, you must cry.

你必须从体内把那一套“别人定义的价值观”哭干净。
You have to cry out that set of "values defined by others" from your body.

哭出你的无助，哭出你的羞耻，哭出你对“成功人士”的怨毒和羡慕。
Cry out your helplessness, cry out your shame, cry out your resentment and envy towards "successful people".

哭够了，站起来。
After crying enough, stand up.

开始想：那我现在要干嘛？
Start thinking: So what should I do now?

不是问别人，不是百度“失业后怎么办”。
Don't ask others, don't search on Baidu "what to do after unemployment".

而是你自己，掂量你手里到底有什么。
But you yourself, figure out what you actually have in your hands.

你以为创业的人都是天生牛逼？
Do you think people who start a business are born awesome?

拜托，大多数人创业是因为——“没工作”。
Come on, most people start a business because - "they have no job".

我认识一个哥们，之前写PPT写到猝死边缘。
I know a guy who was on the verge of collapse from writing PPTs before.

后来被裁员，他就一边送外卖一边拍短视频吐槽公司。
Later, he was laid off. He delivered takeout while shooting short videos to complain about the company.

没想到火了，百万粉丝接广告，开始卖线上课。
Unexpectedly, he became popular, got a million followers, received advertisements, and started selling online courses.

他有什么计划吗？
Did he have any plans?

没有，他只是“在反应”。
No, he was just "reacting".

在生命的每一秒，快速反应，立刻试错。
Reacting quickly and trying and making mistakes immediately in every second of life.

你不缺能力，你缺的是被逼到墙角。
You don't lack the ability; what you lack is being pushed to the corner.

现在你失业了，就是那个墙角。
Now that you're unemployed, this is that corner.

你得自己跳出来。
You have to jump out by yourself.

你说你不知道做什么？
You say you don't know what to do?

随便。
Whatever.

只要动手，就不是原地。
As long as you take action, you're not standing still.

写字、拍视频、剪辑、开小红书、卖闲置、做翻译、代写文案、开陪聊店……
Write, shoot videos, edit, open a Xiaohongshu account, sell second - hand items, do translation, write copywriting, open a chat - accompanying store...

就算你什么都不会，ChatGPT都可以当你半个老师。
Even if you don't know anything, ChatGPT can be your half - teacher.

关键不是你“有没有方向”，而是你根本不敢开始。
The key is not whether you "have a direction", but that you don't dare to start at all.

你把“开始”看得太重了，好像动一下就要写入历史一样。
You take "starting" too seriously, as if making a move is going to be written into history.

你以为只有成功才值得努力。
You think only success is worthy of effort.

可惜，世界不是这么设计的。
Unfortunately, the world is not designed like that.

世界奖励的，从来都不是“想努力”的人，而是“已经动手”的人。
What the world rewards is never the people who "want to work hard", but the people who "have already taken action".

你现在哭，不丢人。
It's not shameful for you to cry now.

不动，才丢人。
Not moving is shameful.

还有，你要学会“自我剥离”。
Also, you have to learn "self - detachment".

什么意思？
What does that mean?

就是从你现在这个“哭哭啼啼的我”中，跳出来。
It means jumping out of this "crying self" of yours.

站到旁观者的位置，看着你自己窝在床上，红着眼，抓着手机翻职位信息。
Stand in the position of an onlooker and watch yourself huddled in bed, with red eyes, flipping through job information on your phone.

你觉得这个人值几个钱？
How much do you think this person is worth?

你想投简历，好。
You want to send out resumes, okay.

你觉得你和别人竞争得过吗？
Do you think you can compete with others?

你连自己都打不过。
You can't even defeat yourself.

你连手机都放不下，连自我厌弃都克服不了。
You can't even put down your phone, and you can't overcome self - loathing.

你去和那些从来不抱怨的人竞争？
You want to compete with those who never complain?

你赢个屁。
You don't stand a chance.

你以为HR喜欢能力强的？
Do you think HR likes people with strong abilities?

错了，HR喜欢“精神状态稳”的。
Wrong, HR likes people with "stable mental states".

连自我精神都无法驾驭的人，怎么能驾驭团队？
How can a person who can't even control their own mental state control a team?

你每天哭，其实是在“养出一张失败者的脸”。
You crying every day is actually "cultivating a loser's face".

每一滴眼泪都在标记你：这个人不稳定，这个人随时可能崩溃。
Every tear is marking you: This person is unstable, this person may collapse at any time.

你以为别人看不出来？
Do you think others can't tell?

那是你太蠢。
You're just too stupid.

这个社会就是一个巨大的筛子。
This society is like a huge sieve.

它筛掉的不是没能力的人，而是“心理强度不够的人”。
What it sifts out is not people without ability, but people with "insufficient psychological strength".

你每天哭，最后会哭出一种“[社会边缘化](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=736115664&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=社会边缘化&zhida_source=entity)”的命运。
You crying every day will eventually lead to a fate of "[social marginalization](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=736115664&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=社会边缘化&zhida_source=entity)".

你会开始远离人群。
You'll start to stay away from people.

你会开始沉默。
You'll start to be silent.

你会越来越羞耻，越来越自闭。
You'll become more and more ashamed and more and more autistic.

最后你会变成一个“连自己都看不起自己”的人。
Finally, you'll become a person who "even despises themselves".

然后你的人生就彻底废了。
And then your life is completely ruined.

所以，我劝你：哭归哭，别哭太久。
So, I advise you: Cry if you must, but don't cry for too long.

哭三天，清醒。
Cry for three days and wake up.

哭三周，毁灭。
Cry for three weeks and be destroyed.

别把悲伤当身份。
Don't take sadness as your identity.

你不是悲剧主角，你不是哪部剧里苦情的楚门。
You're not the tragic protagonist, you're not the suffering Truman in some drama.

你就是一个暂时断电的人。
You're just a person who has temporarily lost power.

你需要充电，而不是崩溃。
You need to recharge, not collapse.

你要知道，成年人是没有“[情绪额度](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=736115664&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=情绪额度&zhida_source=entity)”的。
You have to know that adults don't have a "[emotional quota](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=736115664&content_type=Answer&match_order=1&q=情绪额度&zhida_source=entity)".

你崩溃可以，公司不会等你。
You can collapse, but the company won't wait for you.

房租不会降。
The rent won't decrease.

人情不会多。
Human relations won't increase.

相反，大家只会记住你“那段时间状态不对”。
On the contrary, everyone will just remember that "you were in a bad state during that period".

你崩溃，世界不会给你特权。
The world won't give you special privileges because you're collapsing.

但你开始恢复，哪怕慢一点，你就又有机会。
But if you start to recover, even if it's a little slow, you'll have another chance.

这是这个世界唯一的公平：
This is the only fairness in this world:

“只奖励还在玩的人。”
"It only rewards those who are still in the game."

你必须开始“建设自己”。
You must start "building yourself".

把自己的情绪打包。
Pack up your emotions.

把自己的技能盘点。
Take inventory of your skills.

把自己的生活精简。
Simplify your life.

你甚至可以一点点拆解生活的模块。
You can even break down the modules of life bit by bit.

什么让你痛苦？社交？就断。
What makes you painful? Socializing? Cut it off.

什么让你耗能？手机？就限时。
What drains your energy? Your phone? Set a time limit.

什么让你感到废物？工作？那就做一个你暂时能胜任的“[微型项目]”。
What makes you feel like a waste? Work? Then do a "mini - project" that you can handle for now.

生活是可以被局部重构的。
Life can be locally reconstructed.

你每天哭，是因为你以为生活是一个整体，一崩全崩。
You cry every day because you think life is a whole, and if one part collapses, everything collapses

其实不是。
In fact, it's not.

生活是碎片化的。
Life is fragmented.

你哪怕修好了其中一个碎片，你就有可能撑过今天。
Even if you fix one of the fragments, you may be able to get through today.

别人的人生你学不来。
You can't copy others' lives.

但你可以为“今天的你”撑起一个可控的模型。
But you can build a controllable model for "you today".

早起一小时。
Get up an hour early.

学习三十分钟。
Study for thirty minutes.

接一个小活。
Take on a small job.

洗干净自己。
Clean yourself up.

去楼下晒会儿太阳。
Go downstairs and soak up some sun.

别再躺着骂社会。
Stop lying around cursing society.

别再刷着B站骂资本家。
Stop watching Bilibili and cursing capitalists.

别再看着朋友的朋友圈自怨自艾。
Stop looking at your friends' moments and feeling sorry for yourself.

你不是他们。
You're not them.

他们也不是你。
They're not you.

你不是失败者，你是未完成者。
You're not a loser, you're an unfinished one.

但未完成，必须得“自己接着写”。
But the unfinished part must be "continued by yourself".

没人会替你写下去。
No one will write it for you.

要么活出自己的剧本，要么沦为别人的背景板。
Either live out your own script or become a backdrop for others.

这是我的建议。
This is my advice.

不高尚，不治愈，不光明。
It's not noble, not healing, not bright.

但它真实。
But it's real.

它来自一个每天都在跟命运搏斗，还能喘气的人。
It comes from someone who struggles with fate every day and is still breathing.

如果你听得懂，那就站起来。
If you understand, then stand up.

现在，马上。
Now, right away.

别他妈再哭了。
Stop fucking crying.
